		<h1> “Quit quarreling with God. Agree with Him and you will have peace at last." </h1>
		<p> The site continues to define peace as making things right with God. That is by faith one will know what is God's will and follow it, by this one makes things right with God. “So now, since we have been made right in God's sight by faith in his promises, we can have real peace with him because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us" (Romans 5:1). And further the site continues to define peace as obeying God's law. As in Psalm 119:165, "Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble." In essence the scripture emphasizes that through following God's law one will find everlasting peace. The different aspects of peace in this site is extremely relevant to the chivalrous way of life. First of all, it is impossible to be a successful chivalrous knight when he is constantly quarreling with God.  </p>
